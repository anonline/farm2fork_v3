# Order Management Implementation Summary

## Database Migration

Run the following SQL migration to create the orders table:

```sql
-- Location: database/migrations/001_create_orders_table.sql
-- Execute this manually in your Supabase database
```

The migration file has been created at `database/migrations/001_create_orders_table.sql` and includes:
- Complete orders table with all required fields
- Proper indexes for performance
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Triggers for automatic timestamp updates
- Comprehensive field documentation

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. New Type Definitions
- **Created**: `src/types/order-management.ts`
  - Defines order-related types: `IOrderData`, `ICreateOrderData`, `OrderStatus`, `PaymentStatus`, etc.

### 2. New Actions
- **Created**: `src/actions/order-management.ts`
  - `createOrder()` - Creates new orders in the database
  - `getOrderById()` - Retrieves order details
  - `updateOrderStatus()` - Updates order status with history tracking
  - `updatePaymentStatus()` - Updates payment status with history tracking

### 3. Modified Checkout Components
- **Modified**: `src/sections/checkout/checkout-payment.tsx`
  - Added order creation logic to `onSubmit` function
  - Validates form data and creates order before completing checkout
  - Shows success/error messages during order creation
  - Stores order ID for the completion page

- **Modified**: `src/sections/checkout/checkout-order-complete.tsx`
  - Displays actual order ID instead of hardcoded value
  - Retrieves order ID from localStorage
  - Updated text to Hungarian
  - Cleans up localStorage after displaying order ID

## Database Schema

The orders table includes these key fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | TEXT | Unique order identifier (format: ORD-{timestamp}-{random}) |
| `date_created` | TIMESTAMP | Order creation timestamp |
| `customer_id` | TEXT | Reference to auth.users(id) |
| `customer_name` | TEXT | Customer name at time of order |
| `billing_emails` | TEXT[] | Billing email addresses |
| `notify_emails` | TEXT[] | Notification email addresses |
| `note` | TEXT | Order notes/comments |
| `shipping_address` | JSONB | Shipping address details |
| `billing_address` | JSONB | Billing address details |
| `deny_invoice` | BOOLEAN | Whether customer denied invoice |
| `need_vat` | BOOLEAN | Whether VAT is required |
| `surcharge_amount` | DECIMAL | Additional surcharge amount |
| `items` | JSONB | Array of order items |
| `subtotal` | DECIMAL | Subtotal before taxes/shipping |
| `shipping_cost` | DECIMAL | Shipping cost |
| `vat_total` | DECIMAL | Total VAT amount |
| `discount_total` | DECIMAL | Total discount amount |
| `total` | DECIMAL | Final total amount |
| `payed_amount` | DECIMAL | Amount already paid |
| `shipping_method` | JSONB | Shipping method details |
| `payment_method` | JSONB | Payment method details |
| `payment_status` | TEXT | Payment status (pending, paid, failed, etc.) |
| `order_status` | TEXT | Order status (pending, confirmed, processing, etc.) |
| `payment_due_days` | INTEGER | Days until payment is due |
| `courier` | TEXT | Courier service name |
| `planned_shipping_date_time` | TIMESTAMP | Planned shipping date/time |
| `simplepay_data_json` | JSONB | SimplePay integration data |
| `invoice_data_json` | JSONB | Invoice data |
| `history` | JSONB | Order status history |

## Security

- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Users can only view their own orders
- Authenticated users can create orders
- Admins can view all orders

## Next Steps

1. **Run the database migration** in your Supabase console
2. **Test the checkout flow** to ensure orders are created properly
3. **Verify order data** in the database after test orders
4. **Consider adding**:
   - Order management dashboard for admins
   - Order tracking for customers
   - Email notifications when orders are created
   - Integration with payment processors (SimplePay)
   - Invoice generation functionality

## Usage

When a customer completes checkout:

1. Form validation occurs
2. Order data is prepared from checkout state
3. `createOrder()` is called to save to database
4. Order ID is returned and stored in localStorage
5. Customer is redirected to completion page
6. Completion page displays the order ID
7. Cart is reset

The order will have initial status "pending" and payment status "pending". Use the update functions to change these as the order progresses through fulfillment.
